    Do not change the order of elements in the validOperators array. If a delimiter is recognised through a regex which is a subexpression of another regex, the smaller one must appear later in the checking order. For example, the loop in evalTerm() should not look for "<" before "<=", or for ">" before ">=".

    The add() methods do not allow negative sums, to avoid the absurd possibility of a negative physical damage. If negative values are required, make use of the reverse() method.
